## Print each part

## Safety first

**It is important that you observe the correct safety procedures specified in the data sheet for your specific 3D printer.**

Potential hazards include:

- Hot surfaces and thermoplastics (print head block and lamp)
- Ultraviolet radiation (lamp)
- High voltage (lamp connector, electric outlet)
- Moving parts (printing assembly)



The 3D printer we used for the black parts shown was an [Up Plus 2](https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/up-plus-2), called the Afinia H480 in the US, using ABS filament. Because there are so many different types of 3D printer, we cannot possibly provide instructions for them all. We can only provide rough guidance here and you'll need to figure out the rest on your own.

Here are some top tips though:

- Spend some time making sure your printer is properly calibrated and tested
- [PLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid) is more reliable and nicer to print with than [ABS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene)
- A [Zebra](http://www.printinz.com/zebra-plates/) or [Buildtak](http://www.buildtak.eu/) plate provides a great surface to print on without any extra adhesive being required
- If your printer has a Z probe sensor, this will help compensate for the bed not being perfectly level; ensure it's working correctly if you have one

To get a nice finish we recommend you print on a high detail setting; this is usually a number specified in [microns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre) in the 3D printer software. The lower this number is, the more precise the model will be. Please also be aware that precise prints take longer and, for these models, each piece can take up to **four** hours to complete. Make sure you have enough filament.

The STL files should have the models like this by default, but please make sure you print in the orientations shown below in order to minimise scaffolding and rafting.
