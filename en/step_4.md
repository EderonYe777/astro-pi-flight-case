## Get access to a 3D printer

First and foremost, you'll need access to a 3D printer to do this. Many schools now have their own, but if your school doesn't then you may be able to find one at your local [hackspace](http://www.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page). You can also find local 3D printing services through the [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) website.
