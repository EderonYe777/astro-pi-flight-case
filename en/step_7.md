The kit already contains buttons, but if you want to buy the exact buttons used in the Astro Pi flight unit, the details are below. At about Â£9 each they are expensive, because they're designed to survive an enormous number of clicks before wearing out, which is necessary for a seven-year space mission.

- Manufacturer: APEM
- Manufacturer Part No: 104350003
